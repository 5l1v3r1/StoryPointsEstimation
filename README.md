Software maintenance is a process which is difficult to understand and manage. Yet it is fundamental for software survival. During the software life cycle, maintenance may account for an important part of the effort spent during development. Hence it is worthwhile for industries to study the maintenance workflow, to understand what is happening and to see where the process can be improved.

The analysis and prediction of the time required to implement a maintenance task (e.g. bug-fixing) is fundamental to schedule the maintenance workload and the resource allocation of the company.
